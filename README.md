Task:
  To get details from user and display it in a unique layout.
  I used two libraries from "androidarsenal.com".Frisson layout and Shimmerlayout to display the details from user.
How to use:
  clone or download the project and import in android studio.
Note:
  The layout files
      *activity_display.xml
      *activity_main.xml
      *layoutfromlibrary.xml
  are under res directory.Move these files to layout directory and run the project.
